A shortcoming, however, was the tight coupling of multiple components within the React framework due to extensive data interactions between different components. This strategy avoided complex management of global state to some extent but reduced code reusability and limited testing convenience. In future projects, a more refined component division is needed to reduce inter-component coupling and enhance code maintainability, testability, and scalability."
