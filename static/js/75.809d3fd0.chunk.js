I adopted TypeScript to ensure high code quality and maintainability.

A shortcoming, however, was the tight coupling of multiple components within the React framework due to extensive data interactions between different components. This strategy avoided complex management of global state to some extent but reduced code reusability and limited testing convenience. In future projects, a more refined component division is needed to reduce inter-component coupling and enhance code maintainability, testability, and scalability."}],"link":"https://enmmmmovo.github.io/Airbnb/","repo":"https://github.com/EnmmmmOvO/Airbnb","imageSize":60,"image":["airbnb/logo.svg","airbnb/1.png","airbnb/2.png","airbnb/3.png","airbnb/4.png","airbnb/5.png","airbnb/6.png","airbnb/7.png"]},{"logo":"kaggle.png","type":"Neural Network","title":"Stable Diffusion - Image to Prompts","description":"This project is an Neural Network Project on Kaggle, it aims to to generate prompt words that align with the content of the input images.","content":[],"repo":"https://github.com/GATA-Chen/COMP9417_Project","paper":"http://3.25.181.130/documents/9417%20Report.pdf","imageSize":80,"image":["imageToPrompt/logo.svg"]}]}')}}]);
